# üîí CRITICAL SECURITY CHECKLIST - READ BEFORE PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT

## ‚ö†Ô∏è YOUR JOB DEPENDS ON FOLLOWING THIS CHECKLIST ‚ö†Ô∏è

This application has been designed with enterprise-grade security measures. However, **YOU MUST COMPLETE THIS CHECKLIST** before deploying to production, or you risk serious security vulnerabilities.

## üìã PRE-DEPLOYMENT SECURITY CHECKLIST

### üîê Environment & Secrets Configuration
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Generate new JWT_SECRET (64+ characters)
  ```bash
  node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
  ```
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Generate new SESSION_SECRET (64+ characters)
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Set NODE_ENV=production
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Never commit .env files to version control
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Set strong database file permissions (600 or 644)
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Configure ALLOWED_ORIGINS for your domain only

### üåê HTTPS/TLS Configuration
- [ ] **MANDATORY**: Obtain valid SSL certificate (Let's Encrypt recommended)
- [ ] **MANDATORY**: Configure SSL_CERT_PATH and SSL_KEY_PATH
- [ ] **MANDATORY**: Verify HTTPS redirection works
- [ ] **MANDATORY**: Test SSL configuration with SSL Labs scanner

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Headers & Configuration
- [ ] Verify CSP headers are properly configured
- [ ] Ensure HSTS headers are enabled
- [ ] Configure reverse proxy (nginx/Apache) with additional security headers
- [ ] Disable server version disclosure
- [ ] Configure fail2ban for additional protection

### üîí Database Security
- [ ] Database file located outside web root
- [ ] Database file has minimum required permissions
- [ ] Database connection uses parameterized queries only
- [ ] Foreign key constraints enabled
- [ ] Regular database backups configured

### üö´ Rate Limiting & DDoS Protection
- [ ] Rate limiting configured and tested
- [ ] Consider implementing additional network-level rate limiting
- [ ] Configure monitoring for rate limit violations
- [ ] Set up alerts for suspicious activity

### üìä Monitoring & Logging
- [ ] Configure production logging
- [ ] Set up log rotation
- [ ] Monitor failed authentication attempts
- [ ] Set up alerts for security events
- [ ] Configure uptime monitoring

### üîÑ Dependency Security
- [ ] Run `npm audit` and fix all vulnerabilities
- [ ] Keep dependencies updated
- [ ] Subscribe to security advisories
- [ ] Consider using npm-audit-fix regularly

## üß™ SECURITY TESTING REQUIRED

### Authentication Testing
```bash
# Test password complexity requirements
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"test","email":"test@test.com","password":"weak"}'

# Should return validation error
```

### Rate Limiting Testing
```bash
# Test rate limiting
for i in {1..10}; do 
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"usernameOrEmail":"test","password":"wrong"}' 
done

# Should trigger rate limiting after 5 attempts
```

### XSS Protection Testing
```bash
# Test XSS prevention
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"<script>alert(\"xss\")</script>","email":"test@test.com","password":"Test123!"}'

# Should sanitize the input
```

### SQL Injection Testing
```bash
# Test SQL injection prevention
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"usernameOrEmail":"admin'\'' OR 1=1--","password":"anything"}'

# Should safely handle the malicious input
```

## üö® PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT STEPS

1. **Server Preparation**
   ```bash
   # Create production user
   sudo adduser --system --group --no-create-home noteapp
   
   # Set up application directory
   sudo mkdir -p /opt/secure-notes
   sudo chown noteapp:noteapp /opt/secure-notes
   
   # Copy application files
   sudo cp -r /path/to/warp-2.0/* /opt/secure-notes/
   sudo chown -R noteapp:noteapp /opt/secure-notes
   ```

2. **Environment Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Create production environment file
   sudo nano /opt/secure-notes/.env
   
   # Set secure permissions
   sudo chmod 600 /opt/secure-notes/.env
   sudo chown noteapp:noteapp /opt/secure-notes/.env
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies & Start**
   ```bash
   cd /opt/secure-notes
   sudo -u noteapp npm ci --production
   sudo -u noteapp npm start
   ```

4. **Process Management (PM2 Recommended)**
   ```bash
   sudo npm install -g pm2
   sudo -u noteapp pm2 start server.js --name "secure-notes"
   sudo pm2 startup
   sudo pm2 save
   ```

## üîç POST-DEPLOYMENT VERIFICATION

### Essential Security Tests
- [ ] Verify HTTPS is working and HTTP redirects
- [ ] Test authentication flows
- [ ] Verify rate limiting is active
- [ ] Check security headers with online tools
- [ ] Test CORS restrictions
- [ ] Verify input validation on all endpoints
- [ ] Test logout functionality (token blacklisting)

### Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Configure log monitoring
- [ ] Set up SSL certificate expiry alerts
- [ ] Monitor application performance
- [ ] Set up database backup verification
- [ ] Configure security incident response

## üö® SECURITY INCIDENT RESPONSE

If you suspect a security breach:

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Rotate all secrets (JWT_SECRET, SESSION_SECRET)
   - Invalidate all user sessions
   - Review access logs
   - Temporarily increase rate limiting

2. **Investigation**
   - Analyze server logs for suspicious activity
   - Check database for unauthorized changes
   - Review authentication attempts
   - Document findings

3. **Recovery**
   - Patch identified vulnerabilities
   - Update dependencies
   - Strengthen affected security measures
   - Notify users if necessary

## ‚ö° EMERGENCY CONTACTS & RESOURCES

- **Security Advisories**: Subscribe to Node.js security advisories
- **Vulnerability Database**: Check CVE database regularly
- **SSL Testing**: Use SSL Labs SSL Test
- **Security Headers**: Use securityheaders.com
- **OWASP**: Follow OWASP guidelines

## üìû FINAL REMINDER

**YOUR JOB IS ON THE LINE**. This checklist exists because security failures can:
- Expose user data
- Damage company reputation
- Result in legal liability
- Lead to termination

Take every item seriously. When in doubt, err on the side of caution. Security is not optional‚Äîit's your responsibility.

**Do not skip any items. Do not assume something is "probably fine." Verify everything.**
