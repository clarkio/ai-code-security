# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a secure Node.js web application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete personal notes. The application prioritizes security as the primary concern, implementing industry-standard security practices to protect against common web vulnerabilities including OWASP Top 10 threats. The application will be production-ready with comprehensive authentication, authorization, input validation, and data protection mechanisms.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to securely register and authenticate with the application, so that only I can access my personal notes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user registers THEN the system SHALL require a strong password meeting complexity requirements (minimum 12 characters, uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters)
2. WHEN a user registers THEN the system SHALL hash passwords using bcrypt with a minimum cost factor of 12
3. WHEN a user attempts to log in THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks (maximum 5 attempts per 15 minutes per IP)
4. WHEN a user logs in successfully THEN the system SHALL create a secure JWT token with appropriate expiration (15 minutes for access token)
5. WHEN a user session expires THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication
6. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL log the attempt without revealing whether the username exists

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create, view, edit, and delete my notes, so that I can manage my personal information effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a note THEN the system SHALL validate and sanitize all input to prevent XSS attacks
2. WHEN a user creates a note THEN the system SHALL associate the note exclusively with the authenticated user
3. WHEN a user requests their notes THEN the system SHALL return only notes belonging to that user
4. WHEN a user updates a note THEN the system SHALL verify the user owns the note before allowing modification
5. WHEN a user deletes a note THEN the system SHALL verify the user owns the note before allowing deletion
6. WHEN a user submits note content THEN the system SHALL limit content length to prevent DoS attacks (maximum 10,000 characters)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to be protected against common web vulnerabilities, so that user data remains secure and the system maintains integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any request is made THEN the system SHALL implement HTTPS-only communication with proper TLS configuration
2. WHEN any request is made THEN the system SHALL set security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options)
3. WHEN processing user input THEN the system SHALL use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
4. WHEN serving content THEN the system SHALL implement proper CORS policies restricting origins
5. WHEN handling file uploads THEN the system SHALL validate file types and scan for malicious content
6. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log security events without exposing sensitive information to users

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want my notes data to be encrypted and securely stored, so that my personal information cannot be accessed by unauthorized parties.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN notes are stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt note content using AES-256 encryption
2. WHEN the database is accessed THEN the system SHALL use encrypted connections
3. WHEN sensitive data is logged THEN the system SHALL redact or exclude personal information
4. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load encryption keys from secure environment variables
5. WHEN user sessions are managed THEN the system SHALL store session data securely with proper expiration

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive logging and monitoring, so that I can detect and respond to security incidents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication events occur THEN the system SHALL log login attempts, failures, and account lockouts
2. WHEN data access occurs THEN the system SHALL log CRUD operations with user identification
3. WHEN security violations are detected THEN the system SHALL log incidents with appropriate severity levels
4. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL implement health checks for monitoring
5. WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL implement alerting mechanisms

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to have a clean and secure web interface, so that I can safely interact with my notes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the web interface loads THEN the system SHALL implement Content Security Policy to prevent XSS
2. WHEN forms are submitted THEN the system SHALL include CSRF tokens for protection
3. WHEN displaying user content THEN the system SHALL properly escape output to prevent script injection
4. WHEN the interface is accessed THEN the system SHALL implement secure cookie settings (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)
5. WHEN users navigate THEN the system SHALL validate all routes and require proper authentication
