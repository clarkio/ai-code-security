## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue
2. Email security details to: [your-email@domain.com]
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Timeline**: Depends on severity
  - Critical: 24-48 hours
  - High: 7 days
  - Medium: 30 days
  - Low: Next release cycle

## Security Measures

### Authentication

- Bcrypt password hashing (12 rounds)
- JWT with secure signing
- HTTP-only, signed cookies
- Rate limiting on auth endpoints
- Account lockout after failed attempts

### Input Validation

- Express-validator for all inputs
- XSS protection (xss-clean)
- NoSQL injection prevention
- HPP (HTTP Parameter Pollution) prevention
- Input length restrictions

### HTTP Security

- Helmet.js security headers
- Content Security Policy
- HSTS
- X-Frame-Options (clickjacking protection)
- X-Content-Type-Options

### Authorization

- Resource ownership validation
- Route-level authentication
- User isolation

### Rate Limiting

- Global: 100 requests/15 min
- Auth endpoints: 5 attempts/15 min
- Request body size: 10kb max

### Data Protection

- Passwords never exposed in responses
- Secure session management
- CORS with allowed origins
- SameSite cookies (CSRF protection)

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Password Requirements

- Minimum 8 characters
- Must include:
  - Uppercase letter
  - Lowercase letter
  - Number
  - Special character (@$!%\*?&)

### Recommendations

- Use unique passwords
- Enable HTTPS in production
- Regular password changes
- Monitor account activity
- Report suspicious behavior

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations

1. **In-Memory Storage**: Demo uses in-memory storage. Production should use:

   - Encrypted database at rest
   - Regular backups
   - Secure connection strings

2. **Rate Limiting**: Uses in-memory store. Multi-instance deployments need Redis.

3. **Sessions**: Stateless JWT. For additional security, consider:
   - Token refresh mechanism
   - Token blacklisting
   - Shorter token expiration

### Production Requirements

- [ ] HTTPS/TLS enabled
- [ ] Database with encryption at rest
- [ ] Redis for distributed rate limiting
- [ ] Strong secret keys (48+ chars)
- [ ] CORS restricted to production domains
- [ ] Regular security audits
- [ ] Automated dependency updates
- [ ] Log monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Backup and disaster recovery

## Security Checklist

### Before Deployment

- [ ] All default secrets changed
- [ ] Environment variables secured
- [ ] HTTPS enabled
- [ ] Database credentials secured
- [ ] CORS properly configured
- [ ] Rate limits appropriate
- [ ] Error messages don't leak info
- [ ] Logging configured (no sensitive data)
- [ ] Security headers verified
- [ ] Dependencies up to date
- [ ] npm audit clean

### Ongoing Maintenance

- [ ] Weekly: Review logs
- [ ] Weekly: Check failed auth attempts
- [ ] Monthly: npm audit
- [ ] Monthly: Dependency updates
- [ ] Quarterly: Security audit
- [ ] Quarterly: Penetration testing

## Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline

1. **Day 0**: Vulnerability reported
2. **Day 1-2**: Acknowledgment sent
3. **Day 3-7**: Verification and assessment
4. **Day 8-30**: Fix development and testing
5. **Day 31**: Security patch released
6. **Day 45**: Public disclosure (after fix deployed)
