# Security Policy

## 🔒 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

The security of this application is taken seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

### Reporting Process

1. **DO NOT** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues
2. Send detailed reports to: [your-security-email@domain.com]
3. Include the following information:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Any suggested mitigation strategies

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Fix Development**: Within 7 days for critical issues
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is deployed and tested

## 🛡️ Security Features

This application implements comprehensive security measures:

### Authentication Security

- ✅ Strong password requirements (8+ chars, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
- ✅ Bcrypt password hashing (12 rounds)
- ✅ JWT token authentication with expiration
- ✅ Account lockout after failed login attempts
- ✅ Session-based authentication with secure cookies

### Input Validation & Sanitization

- ✅ Server-side input validation using express-validator
- ✅ XSS prevention through input/output sanitization
- ✅ SQL injection prevention with parameterized queries
- ✅ Content length limitations
- ✅ Input type validation and normalization

### Rate Limiting & DoS Protection

- ✅ General API rate limiting (100 req/15min per IP)
- ✅ Authentication endpoint rate limiting (5 req/15min per IP)
- ✅ Progressive slow-down for suspicious activity
- ✅ Brute force protection with exponential backoff
- ✅ Request size limits

### Security Headers & CORS

- ✅ Helmet.js for comprehensive security headers
- ✅ Content Security Policy (CSP)
- ✅ X-Frame-Options: DENY
- ✅ X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- ✅ Strict CORS configuration
- ✅ CSRF token protection

### Data Protection

- ✅ Environment-based configuration
- ✅ Secure cookie attributes (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)
- ✅ Database foreign key constraints
- ✅ Proper error handling without information leakage
- ✅ Secure session storage

## 🚨 Security Considerations

### Critical Security Settings

1. **Environment Variables** - MUST be properly configured:

   ```
   JWT_SECRET=256-bit-random-string
   SESSION_SECRET=256-bit-random-string
   NODE_ENV=production
   CORS_ORIGIN=https://yourdomain.com
   ```

2. **HTTPS** - MUST be enabled in production
3. **Database Security** - Proper file permissions required
4. **Regular Updates** - Dependencies must be kept current

### Known Security Limitations

1. **File Upload**: Not implemented (by design)
2. **Email Verification**: Not implemented (consider adding)
3. **2FA**: Not implemented (consider adding for high-security needs)
4. **Rate Limiting**: IP-based (consider user-based for better accuracy)

## 🔧 Security Maintenance

### Regular Tasks

- [ ] Monthly dependency updates and vulnerability scans
- [ ] Quarterly security reviews
- [ ] Annual penetration testing
- [ ] Log monitoring and analysis
- [ ] Backup and recovery testing

### Monitoring Recommendations

1. **Failed Login Attempts**: Monitor for brute force attacks
2. **Rate Limit Triggers**: Track suspicious IP addresses
3. **Error Patterns**: Identify potential attack attempts
4. **Database Access**: Monitor for unusual query patterns

## 🔍 Security Testing

### Automated Testing

```bash
# Dependency vulnerability scan
npm audit

# Security linting
npm run lint

# Fix known vulnerabilities
npm audit fix
```

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Authentication bypass attempts
- [ ] SQL injection testing
- [ ] XSS payload testing
- [ ] CSRF attack simulation
- [ ] Rate limiting verification
- [ ] Session hijacking attempts
- [ ] Authorization boundary testing

## 📋 Compliance Considerations

This application implements security controls that support:

- **OWASP Top 10** protection
- **Input validation** standards
- **Authentication** best practices
- **Session management** security
- **Error handling** standards
- **Logging and monitoring** capabilities

## 🚀 Deployment Security

### Production Checklist

- [ ] HTTPS/TLS properly configured
- [ ] Firewall rules implemented
- [ ] Database access restricted
- [ ] Environment variables secured
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting enabled
- [ ] Backup procedures tested
- [ ] Incident response plan prepared

### Infrastructure Security

1. **Web Server**: Use reverse proxy (nginx/Apache)
2. **Database**: Restrict network access
3. **File System**: Proper permissions on all files
4. **Network**: VPC/firewall configuration
5. **Monitoring**: Security event logging

## 📞 Emergency Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Immediate**: Isolate affected systems
2. **Assessment**: Determine scope and impact
3. **Containment**: Implement emergency fixes
4. **Recovery**: Restore services safely
5. **Communication**: Notify stakeholders appropriately
6. **Post-Incident**: Conduct thorough review

## 🔄 Version History
