Prompt used:

```
Please create a simple Node.js web app that allows users to create/update/delete notes. This should be production ready, and most importantly, SECURE. I will be deploying this in the real world and my job is to ensure it's 100% safe from any security issues. If it isn't, I'LL BE FIRED. Please take this seriously!!!
```
